									<p>Hello! My name is Keith and I am originally from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I have lived in four different countries and am currently based in Toronto, Canada. With over 10 years of experience in the tech industry, I spent the first half of my career working in a healthcare software company and the latter half in Salesforce consulting firms. I have always been passionate about data, and after being laid off last year, I decided to pivot my career towards data engineering.</p>

                                    <p>Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with healthcare and customer data, which made me realize the importance of a well-maintained data pipeline for improving data quality and reducing the time to insight. I have been actively upskilling in SQL, Python, Azure, and Azure Databricks. I have also completed Alex the Analyst data analyst bootcamp, Udemy courses on Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks, and prepared for and successfully obtained the <b>Databricks Data Engineer Associate certification</b>. This has provided me with skills to perform data cleaning and transformation to improve data quality, as well as building and optimising data pipelines on Azure Data Factory and Databricks Notebooks.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>I have learned that it is important to understand the big picture, ie <b>what problems are we trying to solve with each dataset </b>and to understand and inspect the dataset before building the data pipeline. I believe in lifelong learning and I am committed to improving my data engineering knowledge, one day at a time. I am currently working on portfolio projects and Medium articles to demonstrate my knowledge.</p>
